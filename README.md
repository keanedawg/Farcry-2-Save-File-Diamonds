# Farcry-2-Save-File-Diamonds
Starter FarCry 2 modified save file that includes all the diamonds you would need


Pretty much the base game, you are Josip and the tutorials have been completed but there is no progress otherwise (and you have a bunch of diamonds).

To use it, just download the new.sav file. Then go to you `{your_username}\Documents\My Games\Far Cry 2\Saved Games` (it maybe some other file structure, but it should be underneath documents and put it into the Saved Games folder (or add the folder it if it doesn't exist). Then go to your saved games and Far Cry 2 and open it. Enjoy!

You can use this with the Weapons Unlock to have all the guns starting out.
